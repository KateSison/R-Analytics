I took a chance on these and I am blown away with how they feel and look. I am 400lbs and need to start walking. And when I was able to try them on I was very surprised. I haven't needed to buy insole supports yet and they feel amazing. Its no surprise why they were sold out of so many colors. But the blue still looks great.

"Shoes","Bruno Marc Men's KnitFlex Breeze Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes","LGC","Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Rather than my husband always wearing sneakers with chinos or jeans I came across these Bruno Marc’s.The appearance, reviews and number of buyers is what persuaded me to buy the them over the other brands.He tried them on today but hasn’t worn them so this review is a first impression. I may come back in late September to let you know if there were any negatives about the wear.The shoe out of the box is impressive. Lightweight casual dress. The material of the upper shoe has some type of elastacine (sp) that gives it some stretch/give when you walk. They are breathable which is important to him.I’m not sure if they will stretch overtime but if they do, a tightening of the shoe strings should provide more support.The inner soul is removable for anyone who wears orthotics. My husband does, but after trying them on with and without, he said the foot bed is comfortable enough he may not need the orthopedics for times that he won’t be doing much walking.The shoe laces are a tightly woven fabric over elastic and they hold firmly when tied. The shoe soul is rubberized material, is lightweight and provides for a comfortable sneaker like feel.He buys sizes 8 but his true size is 7.5. He said his toes still have about 1/2” to the end of the shoe and the toe box is very roomy. He likes that because some shoes squeeze his forefoot. No pain in these.We purchased the navy and the color is beautiful.I tried them on and I would be very comfortable wearing them.At this point, we have to give them a 5 star rating. Even though we can’t speak to the performance at this time, we believe they are a good value for the price and construction . This is a good looking shoe.",5,NA

"Shoes","Bruno Marc Men's KnitFlex Breeze Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes","Amazon Customer","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2024","Lightweight Casual Dress Shoes","I have yet to wear these out, but from initial trials they seem comfortable and have plenty of toe room, and even though not a ""wide"" size, they accommodate my orthotic and don't bind in areas where I'm developing age-related foot issues.  They are more stylish than a normal athletic shoe while having the comfort of one. A couple drawbacks I'll learn to live with: This style, in a longer size, really exaggerates how long they look on the foot. It would help if they had some vertical details/stitching along the upper part to break that long plane from laces to toe. I am a woman who must often go to men's shoes to get the length I need, and while many styles are interchangeable with a woman's version; this one, because of that long stretch of uninterrupted fabric does make me self-conscious about how big my foot looks. The other issue for me is the bright white sole. It is difficult to find a comfortable shoe with a coordinating sole color. The white looks OK on this and keeps them from becoming too oxford-like, but I fear the white will soon be stained by the elements. I bought these to look a little more dressy with dress slacks, and since I can no longer wear leather uppers, these will be fine, and the length should seem less dramatic once there's a pant's cuff. breaking up the total length.  I purchased these for the reasonable price on a shoe I won't wear often. I think they will prove to be exactly what I need: a more dressy looking shoe with the comfort of a sneaker.",4,NA

"Shoes","Bruno Marc Men's KnitFlex Breeze Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes","HB","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2024","","Rather than my husband always wearing sneakers with chinos or jeans I came across these Bruno Marc’s.The appearance, reviews and number of buyers is what persuaded me to buy the them over the other brands.He tried them on today but hasn’t worn them so this review is a first impression. I may come back in late September to let you know if there were any negatives about the wear.The shoe out of the box is impressive. Lightweight casual dress. The material of the upper shoe has some type of elastacine (sp) that gives it some stretch/give when you walk. They are breathable which is important to him.I’m not sure if they will stretch overtime but if they do, a tightening of the shoe strings should provide more support.The inner soul is removable for anyone who wears orthotics. My husband does, but after trying them on with and without, he said the foot bed is comfortable enough he may not need the orthopedics for times that he won’t be doing much walking.The shoe laces are a tightly woven fabric over elastic and they hold firmly when tied. The shoe soul is rubberized material, is lightweight and provides for a comfortable sneaker like feel.He buys sizes 8 but his true size is 7.5. He said his toes still have about 1/2” to the end of the shoe and the toe box is very roomy. He likes that because some shoes squeeze his forefoot. No pain in these.We purchased the navy and the color is beautiful.I tried them on and I would be very comfortable wearing them.At this point, we have to give them a 5 star rating. Even though we can’t speak to the performance at this time, we believe they are a good value for the price and construction . This is a good looking shoe.",5,NA

I've received numerous compliments on them!Overall: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 If you're in the market for a pair of walking shoes that combine comfort, durability, and style, look no further. These Adidas are worth every penny and have made my daily walks something I look forward to. Highly recommended!",5,NA

They seem well-made, attractive and fit very comfortably. I have small wide feet and got the size 9. The Tow box seemed perfectly wide and roomy for me. If they hold up, I’ll probably order another pair. Looks like a very good value for the price.",3,NA
"Shoes","adidas Men's Lite Racer Adapt 7.0 Sneaker","PeterB","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","These Adidas sneakers are very very nice. Super comfy  and they look good on. No laces to tie as they slide on. I wear a sz 14-15 so honestly sliding them on doesn't work so well with such a big foot. I use a shoe horn to help get them on to prevent the back of the sneakers from getting squished up. They provide decent support and are very lightweight. They were prime day deal priced for an exceptional value. I bought a sz 14wide(white/black color) and they fit pretty true to size. With the soft material sides and uppers I would expect a bit of stretching for an even more comfy fit. Very pleased and highly recommended.",5,NA
"Shoes","adidas Men's Lite Racer Adapt 7.0 Sneaker","Eric","Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2024","","I'm impressed with the quality since it is a brand-name item. Usually, brand-name items are of lower quality. But this is very comfortable, soft, and durable. I used these on my last cruise. I like them to fit snugly, but I had to size up a bit. They don't slip, and I would say they do stretch after wearing them. The style is great for young people. The price is good for the amazing quality, but the look of the sneakers is just okay. I love it.",5,NA

I will agree with the other comments that these do tend to run narrow. So if you were debating between a standard width and a wide width, go wide. I feel the wide width shoe fits more like a standard. If you truly need a wide with shoe, you may not be pleased. This is not nearly as wide as the wide width sports shoes you may receive from New Balance or others. I likely would not purchase this again.",4,NA

All are light and comfortable. Nothing beats Allbirds, but these Adidas Lite Racers are almost as comfortable with plenty of arch and ankle support and a wide toe box.  They are slightly heavier, but better quality and will probably outlast the budget brands even for daily jogging.  They look a bit bulkier than in the photos and do take a little effort to slide on. My normal size 10M fit perfectly. Definitely recommend if the price is discounted.",5,NA

Plus, they don’t cost a ton making them a great deal for the money. I really like the all black color and the laces have just a hint of gray in them to give them a little bit of contrast.

"Shoes","adidas Men's Lite Racer Adapt 7.0 Sneaker","Revisor","Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2024","","So, I'm a huge fan of the adidas lite racer series, you don't have to deal with laces and yet they stay firm on the foot. I wore various generations of them for years and have something to say. 3.0 are still the best in terms of design and fit in my opinion, but they are partially discontinued since the selection is extremely limited on amazon currently, so I had no choice but to find a replacement for them. 7.0's fit is decent, very soft and comfy. One aspect these excel in over previous generations is the outer sole. Lite racer series for a long time suffered from their main flaw, which was that the outer sole erodes very fast, 7.0's actually seem decent in this regard, looks like adidas finally addressed this issue. The single biggest issue with these shoes is quality control. I had to return a couple of them before I got an acceptable pair. There is a significant inconsistency in the way the insole is attached, to the point where another pair may feel quite different when wearing them.",4,NA

I am normally a size nine and a half or ten so I ordered ten. They fit perfect. The day I received them I used them for my daily walk of seven kilometers (5 miles). Very comfortable walk and no blisters or sore feet. I have used them for my walks for about a week now and I have had no problems and find the shoes are very good for this purpose. I like the slip on factor. It is a bit tight to slip in but I got used to it. Well built slip in for sure. Good arch support as well.",5,NA
